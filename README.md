# TFE-GNN

## Requirements

python == 3.7.6 or 3.10.0

torch == 1.8.1 or 1.12.1

dgl == 0.5.2 or 0.9.0

## Results:
Note that the hyperparameters (in our paper) need to be adjusted manually.
Different versions of DGL and PyTorch can affect model performance, and fine-tuning of 
parameters, including but not limited to hyperparameters and seeds, may be required in 
order to reproduce the effects in theis paper.
# A spectral GNN with triple filter (ours: TFE-GNN)
We run 'tfe_training' to get the results of TFE-GNN. <br />

# GCNII, BernNet, ChebNetII, PCNet, etc.
We provide code links in the article.
